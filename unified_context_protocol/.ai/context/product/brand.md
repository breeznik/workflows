# Brand & Design Guidelines

> **How we sound and how we look.**

## 🗣️ Voice & Tone
- **Principles**: *e.g., Confident but Humble, Technical but Accessible*
- **Do**: *Use active voice, short sentences.*
- **Don't**: *Use jargon, passive voice.*

## 🎨 Design Philosophy
- **Aesthetic**: *e.g., Clean, Minimal, Dark Mode First*
- **Interaction**: *e.g., Fast feedback, Keyboard-first*

## Copywriting Rules
1. **Headlines**: Focus on benefit, not feature.
2. **Buttons**: Action-oriented (e.g., "Start Building", not "Submit").
3. **Errors**: Helpful and human (e.g., "We couldn't find that file", not "Error 404").
